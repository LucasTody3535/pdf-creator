## About

This project aims to provide a simple pdf creation experience, you can add elements to the page using drag`n drop and can position the item where you desire, then if you are satisfied with your file, click the button to generate the pdf, then a new browser window will be opened letting you to dowload your pdf

## Motivation

My primary motivation was to understand more about the browser environment, such as absolute positioning, dom elements creation, and access to dom elements´s styles api and the drag`n drop api

## Tools Used

- Vue for reactivity
- pdfme as the lib which is used to generate the PDF
- drag´n drop api used for dragging elements(without another lib)
